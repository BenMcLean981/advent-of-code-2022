# My Advent-Of-Code 2022 Solution!

This is my solution to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/). I'm going to do my best to keep up with it every day. I'm going to solve it in rust because it is a language I'd like to become more experienced with.

As this is one of my first Rust endeavours, this might not be the cleanest solution you've ever seen. But I will be making an effort to keep things clean and well organized.

My plan at the time of writing is to have the `fn main` printout the solutions to each day's problems with a little title card. Each day will be contained in it's own package and will be responsible for itself. Code in day_25 will not have anything to do with code in day_1. I may revisit this as time goes on.

### Running my Solution

1. Make sure you have rust installed (I'm on 1.64.0).
2. Clone this repository.
3. From the project root do `cargo run`.
